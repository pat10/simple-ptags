# simple-ptags
This little Perl script simply takes the contents of a txt file and adds paragraph &lt;p> tags into a new HTML file.

Assuming you have Perl installed (and you should if you have Mac or Linux -- <a href="https://learn.perl.org/installing/windows.html" target="_blank">Windows users go here</a>), go to the directory where the script is installed and type:

<code>perl ptags.pl</code>

It will ask what txt file you want to convert. To save typing, have the Perl and txt files in the same directory.

Enjoy your ptags!
